\section{access}
to read or modify the value of an object
\begin{itemize}
\item[NOTE 1] Where only one of these two actions is meant, ``read'' or ``modify'' is used.
\item[NOTE 2] ``Modify'' includes the case where the value being stored is the same as the previous value.
\item[NOTE 3] Expressions that are not evaluated do not access objects.
\end{itemize}
\section{argument}
expression in the comma-separated list bounded by the parentheses in a function call expression, or a sequence of preprocessing tokens in the comma-separated list bounded by the parentheses in a function-like macro invocation
\section{behavior}
external appearance or action
\subsection{implementation-defined behavior}
unspecified behavior where each implementation documents how the choice is made.
\subsection{undefined behavior}
behavior, upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous data,
for which this Standard imposes no requirements.
\section{bit}
unit of data storage in the execution environment large enough to hold an object that may have one of two values
\section{element}
part of a value, variable, reference, or another element. Elements can be split into two catagories, value-elements and variable-elements
\subsection{value-element}
A value-element can be defined inductively as an element of a value, or an element of a value-element
\subsection{variable-element}
A variable-element can be defined inductively as an element of a variable, or an element of a variable-element
\section{forward reference}
reference to a later section of this Standard that contains additional information relevant to this subclause
\section{reference}
a relation to the part or whole of another variable, element, or reference. This is the opposite of an element
\subsection{return-reference}
a reference to an object that acts as an additional return value for a function
\section{parameter}
variable declared as part of a function declaration that aquires a value or return-reference upon entry into the function, or a name denoting a replacement inside a function-like macro
