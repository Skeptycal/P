\section{Premise}
The P Programming language is a new programming language. It is based on the syntax of C, however with different semantics. The key difference is that pointer assignment 
operations appear to the programmer as a deep copy. Furthermore pointers passed into functions do no alias with each other from the perspective of the function being 
called.
