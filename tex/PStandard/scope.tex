This standard specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of programs 
written 
in the \lP programming language.
It specifies
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] the representation of \lP programs;
\item[-] the syntax and constraints of the \lP language;
\item[-] the semantic rules for interpreting \lP programs;
\item[-] the representation of output data produced by \lP programs;
\item[-] the restrictions and limits imposed by a conforming implentation of \lP
\end{itemize}

This standard does not specify
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] the mechanism by which \lP programs are transformed or invoked for use by a data-processing system;
\item[-] the mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a \lP program;
\item[-] the mechanism by which output data are transformed after being produced by a \lP program;
\item[-] the size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity of an specific data-processing system or the capacity of a particular processor;
\item[-] all minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of supporting a conforming implementation.
\end{itemize}
